Life is a war to me and I choose to fight it. I faced many difficulties before and now I have beaten them. I am now enjoying the life I am leading.

I have been interested in mathematics and numbers since childhood. When I entered university I chose Computer Science as my major because I wanted to explore more in the technology area. At the same time I 
was doing a minor in Mathematics. I have changed to a Statistics major, because it is more useful in solving real world problems than pure mathematics.

Due to the heavy workload I spend most of my time doing university assignments and projects. However I try to enjoy my life without a monitor whenever 
I get a chance. For example recently I have become interested in sustainable development. Therefore I am trying my best to 
recycle and not to waste food.

    The Communications and Marketing Department is working on the Web Improvement Project. I support the developers and the content writers. 
    My tasks are mainly working with the Content Management System \emph{SquizMatrix} including:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item Loading the content into \emph{SquizMatrix}.
      \item Cropping pictures using \emph{Photoshop} and loading them into \emph{SquizMatrix}.
     \end{itemize}
    Though the job is not coding intensive, my experiences in programming has made it easy for me to use \emph{SquizMatrix} since there are 
    references passing around in \emph{SquizMatrix} and the fact that \emph{SquizMatrix} uses the JSON and HTML formats.
